            <h1>21 Sewage Treatment Plants in Delhi Fail to Meet Standards</h1>
            <p class="date"><strong>Date:</strong> October 2024</p>

                <p><strong>Flooded streets in Gurgaon</strong></p>
            </div>
    
            <p><strong>Report Summary:</strong><br>Out of the 37 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Delhi, 21 failed to meet essential standards in several water quality parameters during August, according to a report by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC). The STPs, which were tested for key metrics like faecal coliform, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), oil and grease, and dissolved phosphates, showed that 56% were unable to meet the required benchmarks. This continues the trend observed in July and June.</p>
    
            <p>The treated or untreated water from these STPs often ends up in the Yamuna and is used for horticulture, further raising concerns about water safety and pollution. Key areas where the STPs underperformed were in TSS, BOD, COD, and faecal coliform levels. The BOD parameter indicates how much oxygen is needed for the water to naturally decompose organic matter, while faecal coliform levels indicate the presence of untreated sewage.</p>
    
            <h2>Impact on the Environment:</h2>
            <p>The continuous failure of the sewage treatment plants to meet environmental standards exacerbates the pollution problem in the Yamuna River and impacts public health. Efforts to improve the quality of the treated water must be prioritized to ensure a safer and cleaner environment for the city.</p>
